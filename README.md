## LiquidLink Staking Integration Example
This example is divided into two parts: frontend and Move smart contract.

The main logic resides in the Move contract, where we demonstrate a simple staking mechanism.
By reviewing the provided example contract, you can learn how to integrate LiquidLink's point system directly within your on-chain logic.

Once integrated, you can notify the LiquidLink team, and we will help you enable a dedicated point system on the frontend for your project.
